To the moon, lmao.

## What did I learn?

1. **Bem Methodology:** Above all I think this was my most important learning on this project, the conventions made it much easier to structure and using SASS was a WOW! A new me when it comes to styling, literally. I still have a very long way to go in making components more flexible and independent but I'm very glad I started. 

2. **Styles:** SASS /.SCSS is the ansewer. Plain CSS nevermore ðŸ¤«. I don't have to look into a jungle of files if my selector was already taken lol. Webpack modules does the job for me and SASS is just awesome. Nesting is just perfect for _Bem_, Variables and operators are super useful.

  First time using:
  * SASS: `$variables`, `&nesting`, `%extend`
  * `position` Absolute, relative, fixed (Finally)
  * `grid` template, columns, rows, repeat, minmax, fr, auto-fill, gap > instead of flex!
  * Pseudoelements `:before` `:after`
  * `filter` and `mask-image` for cool effects.
  * `keyframes` and `animation` for some movement
