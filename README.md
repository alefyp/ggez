## What did I learn?

1. **Bem Methodology:** Above all I think this was my most important learning on this project, the conventions made this much easier to structure and using SASS was a WOW! A new me when it comes to styling, literally. I still have a very long way to go in making components more flexible and independent but I'm very glad I started. 

```
<div class=${styles.hero__square}>
  <div class=${styles['hero__square-rol']}>
    ...
    </div>
</div>
```

2. **Styles:** SASS /.SCSS is the ansewer. Plain CSS nevermore 🤫. I don't have to look into a jungle of files if my selector was already taken lol. Webpack modules does the job for me and SASS is just awesome. Nesting is just perfect for _Bem_, Variables and operators are super useful.
    First time using:
    * SASS: `$variables` `&nesting` `%extend`
    * `position` Absolute, relative, fixed (Finally)
    * `grid` template, columns, rows, repeat, minmax, fr, auto-fill, gap > instead of flex!
    * Pseudoelements `:before` `:after`
    * `filter` and `mask-image` for cool effects.
    * `keyframes` and `animation` for some movement

2. **MVC Arquitecture:** I tried to approach an MVC architecture, a little late, not perfect but something came out. 🤷🏻‍♀️
