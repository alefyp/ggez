To the moon, lmao.

### What did I learn?

- **Bem Methodology:** Above all I think this was my most important learning on this project, the conventions made it much easier to structure and using SASS was a WOW! A new me when it comes to styling, literally. I still have a very long way to go in making components more flexible and independent but I'm very glad I started. 

Javascript:

``` <div class=${styles.hero__section}>
        <div class=${styles['hero__section-header']}>
          <h1>${name}</h1>
        </div>
          <div class=${styles.hero__square}>
            <div class=${styles['hero__square-rol']}>
            ... 
```

- **SASS .SCSS:** Plain CSS nevermore ðŸ¤«. I don't have to look into a jungle of files if my selector was already taken lol. Webpack modules does the job for me and SASS is just awesome.
