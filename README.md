_A single web application made with pure javascript, sass and html._

 The main idea was to redo a project I did when I started to study web development and contrast: what am I missing? what can I improve? but at the beginning, I didn't expect to put a lot of details in it. I worked on code I had almost a year ago and changed many others on the fly xD So... this is a **mix** of many little things I was curious to learn.

## I'm using...

- Data and assets from Data Dragon.Thank you <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/docs">rito pls</a> 👌🏻
- `webpack` and `webpack-dev-server`
- Javascript ES6, no framworks | HTML5 | SASS
- Firebase hosting: perfect for SPA 🙌🏻


## What did I learn?

1. **Bem Methodology:** Above all I think this was my most important learning on this project, the conventions made this much easier to structure and using SASS was a WOW! A new me when it comes to styling, literally. I still have a very long way to go in making components more flexible and independent but I'm very glad I started. 

```
<div class=${styles.hero__square}>
  <div class=${styles['hero__square-rol']}>
    ...
    </div>
</div>
```

2. **Styles:** SASS /.SCSS is the ansewer. Plain CSS nevermore 🤫. I don't have to look into a jungle of files if my selector was already taken lol. Webpack modules does the job for me and SASS is just awesome. Nesting is just perfect for _Bem_, Variables and operators are super useful.
    First time using:
    * SASS: `$variables` `&nesting` `%extend`
    * `position` Absolute, relative, fixed (Finally)
    * `grid` template, columns, rows, repeat, minmax, fr, auto-fill, gap > instead of flex!
    * Pseudoelements `:before` `:after`
    * `filter` and `mask-image` for cool effects.
    * `keyframes` and `animation` for some movement

2. **MVC Arquitecture:** I tried to approach an MVC architecture, a little late, not perfect but something came out. 🤷🏻‍♀️

## What I want to keep learning? 

- **A C C E S I B I L I T Y :** There is too much I ignore. 
- **C L E A N   C O D E | G O O D   P R A C T I C E S:** I need to plan my projects in a better way and be more organized! :(
